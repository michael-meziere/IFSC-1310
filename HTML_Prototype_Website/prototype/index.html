    <h3>Athletics</h3>
    <p>UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Baseball</li>
      <li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
      <li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
      <li>Women's Volleyball</li>
      <li>Women's Soccer</li>
      <li>Women's Swimming/Diving</li>
      <li>Men's and Women's Cross Country</li>
      <li>Men's and Women's Track and Field (Indoor and Outdoor)</li>
